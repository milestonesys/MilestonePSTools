# Command Index

All commands in the latest release of MilestonePSTools can be found in the table below, each with a link to their
documentation page. The columns can be sorted - try sorting by the number of users in the last 30 days![^1]

[^1]: Based on [optional telemetry](commands/en-US/about_Telemetry.md).

!!! tip
    To get to the online help for any command in the module from a PowerShell terminal with an internet connection, you may
    use `Get-Help` with the "-Online" switch. For example, `#!powershell Get-Help -Name Get-VmsCameraReport -Online`.
