# Compatibility

According to the [Milestone Product Lifecycle](https://www.milestonesys.com/support/software/product-lifecycle/),
XProtect VMS releases are typically supported for 3 years before being discontinued. As such, our ability to support
MilestonePSTools depends on using a supported version of XProtect.

In the following table you'll find the VMS versions and the most recent version of MilestonePSTools that should be compatible with that VMS version.
